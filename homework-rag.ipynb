    "1. Load: We load in our data using DocumentLoaders. \n",
    "2. Split: Our data is split into chunks in order to be captured within the context window. We will use RecursiveTextSplitter to recursively split our text until the chunks are within the limt \n",
    "3. Store: The split data is then converted into embeddings. Embeddings is a way for text to be represented numerically for computers to understand. These embeddings are then stored in a vector store.\n",
    "4. Retrieve: The most relevant embeddings are retrieved based on a similarity search with the query.\n",
    "5. Generate: Both the query and most relevant context are then passed into the LLM to output the most accurate response."
